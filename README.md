A well-crafted README file is essential for introducing your project, explaining how to set it up, and demonstrating its functionality. Here's a template for a README for your blog application, including the cURL commands for your CRUD operations:

```markdown
# Go Blog Application

This repository contains the code for a simple blog application backend written in Go using the Gin framework, with PostgreSQL for database management.

## Overview

The application supports basic CRUD operations for blog posts. It is designed to serve as a starting point for more complex web applications and includes examples of how to integrate various Go packages for web development.

## Features

- CRUD operations for blog posts
- PostgreSQL integration
- Graceful shutdown of the server
- Prepared statements to avoid SQL injection

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Go (1.x)
- PostgreSQL (12.x)
- A REST client like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or cURL

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

Start the server:

```bash
go run main.go
```

### Environment Variables

Before starting the server, you may need to set the following environment variables:

- `PORT`: The port on which the server will run.
- `DB_CONNECTION_STRING`: The connection string for your PostgreSQL database.

### Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system (if applicable).

## API Usage

Below are the cURL commands to interact with the API:

### Create a Blog Post

```plaintext
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/blogs' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "title": "New Blog Post",
    "content": "This is the content of the new blog post."
}'
```

### Get All Blog Posts

```plaintext
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/blogs'
```

### Get a Single Blog Post

```plaintext
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/blogs/{id}'
```

### Update a Blog Post

```plaintext
curl --location --request PUT 'http://localhost:8080/blogs/{id}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "title": "Updated Blog Post",
    "content": "This is the updated content of the blog post."
}'
```

### Delete a Blog Post

```plaintext
curl --location --request DELETE 'http://localhost:8080/blogs/{id}'
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
